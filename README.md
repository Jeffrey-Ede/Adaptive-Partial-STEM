# Intelligent Partial STEM

This repository is a work in progress!

Intelligent partial scanning transmission electron electron microscopy with reinforcement learning


Important to create an empty `__init__.py` below `dnc` subdirectories to run the code.

# Pretrained Models

Checkpoints for fully trained models are [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LJuaVXEvlfhrZLQiz_LEnoAn59WM2PpI?usp=sharing). They are for experiments 125 (LSTM), 126 (Spirals), and 127 (DNC) after 500k and 1000k training iterations. 

To load the models, change the save location in the `checkpoint` file to your save location.

# Training Data

Datasets containing 19769 STEM images cropped or downsampled to 96x96 are [here](https://github.com/Jeffrey-Ede/datasets/wiki). Other dataset variants are also available.
