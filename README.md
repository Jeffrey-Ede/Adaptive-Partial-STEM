# Intelligent Partial STEM

Intelligent partial scanning transmission electron electron microscopy with reinforcement learning


Important to create an empty `__init__.py` below `dnc` subdirectories to run the code.

# Pre-Trained Models

Checkpoints for fully trained models are (here)[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LJuaVXEvlfhrZLQiz_LEnoAn59WM2PpI?usp=sharing]. They are for experiments 125 (LSTM), 126 (Spirals), and 127 (DNC) after 500k and 1000k iterations.
